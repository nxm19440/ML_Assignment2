Code-1:
I have used for loop and range function to print the ** in the required shape.

Code-2:
Firstly, I used len() function to find the length of the list.
Later using the for loop, I iterated within the list till the length of the list in the range function using the parameter as 2 to iterate by retrieving the odd index values.

Code-3:
Primarily, I defined a list 
Then by iterating over a given list, I retrieved each element type and appended it to a newly defined list.

Code-4:
Here I have defined a function which accepts list as an argument and used a set function to retrieve unique elements of a list and stored it in a set.
Using that set,  I have used for loop and retrieved each element from a set and appended it to a newly defined list and printed out.

Code-5:
I have defined a function test function which accepts String as an argument and using for loop, I have verified if each of the letter in a String is whether upper or lower case and incremented the corresponding count. Then I have printed in the console.
